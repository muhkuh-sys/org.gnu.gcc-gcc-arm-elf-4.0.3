 Documentation of the internals of the support code still needs
 to be written.  The code is changing quickly enough that we
 haven't bothered yet.

-Helper functions for GDB to locate the string tables.
-Since BFD hides string tables from callers, GDB needs to use an
-internal hook to find them.  Sun's .stabstr, in particular,
-isn't even pointed to by the .stab section, so ordinary
-mechanisms wouldn't work to find it, even if we had some.
